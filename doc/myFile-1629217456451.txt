  This test combines
logical reasoning questions with a
question about algorithms and another
about SQL. It allows you to evaluate
both the current programming skills of
the candidate, as well as their
potential, given their capacity for
logical reasoning. Since this
programming test uses pseudo-code it
does not have a bias related to the
knowledge of a specific language.
